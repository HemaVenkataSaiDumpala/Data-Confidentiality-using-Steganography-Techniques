The information security has become one of the most significant problems in data communication. There are many security problems that exist in communication technology which are very critical. One such problem is related to the confidentiality of the message exchange in web. In order to address this problem, cryptography and steganography can be combined. Another major problem is to secure the data from duplication and unauthorized use. For this purpose, Digital Watermarking is used for authentication of data and protection of copyright. The joining of these techniques provide a robust and strong communication system that able to withstand against attackers. Matlab is used as a simulator to implement  the techniques of cryptography, steganography and digital watermarking.
